Create a Banking System, where a user can create a new account, deposit money, withdraw money and
check the balance. A BankAccount is identified by its name, account number and the amount of money
available to that account. For today’s lab we will define the BankAccount class, create object and call
some methods.
What you need to do:
1) Create a BankAccount class and add the following.
a. Add 3 instance variables; name, id and balance.
b. Create a constructor which will take parameters for all attributes. Inside the constructor,
initialize the attributes with that parameter passed to the constructor.
c. Add the following methods as described;
i. public void deposit(double depAmount)
Inside the method increase the balance by the depAmount amount.
ii. public void withdraw(double withAmount)
Inside the method decrease the balance by withAmount amount. Do necessary
checks so that the balance does not become negative.
iii. public double getBalance()
Return the balance attribute from the method.
iv. public void displayInfo()
Inside the method, display the attributes in the format “Name:[name]; Id:[id];
Balance:[balance]”.

2) Now create another class Bank and implement the main method. In main method do the
following.
a. Create an object of the BankAccount class using the constructor you created and pass
appropriate values. Assign the reference of the object to a variable name account. b. Call
withdraw(...) method using the account variable.
c. Call the displayInfo() method using the account variable.
d. Deposit some money by executing the deposit(...) method.
e. Display the balance using the getBalance() method.
